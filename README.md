# Reverse Image Search for E-Commerce Platforms

Built an efficient reverse image search application utilizing Pinecone's vector database and pretrained neural networks to generate vector embeddings.
* 10k+ images reverse image search in less than 100ms.
* Encoding images as vectors using a pretrained neural network (Imagenet)
* Conducting queries on Pinecone's Vector Database to identify images with the highest similarity scores to a given query image
