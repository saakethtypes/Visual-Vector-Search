# Reverse Image Search for E-Commerce Platforms

 Specifically, I focused on utilizing Pinecone's vector database and pretrained neural networks to generate vector embeddings for efficient image similarity comparisons. Key accomplishments include:

Demonstrating the value of Pinecone for solving real-time image search requirements
Implementing storage and retrieval of vectors in Pinecone's dedicated Vector Database
Encoding images as vectors using a pretrained neural network, eliminating the need for model training
Conducting queries on Pinecone's Vector Database to identify images with the highest similarity scores to a given query image
Achieving exceptional performance with results returned in mere milliseconds on average
Showcasing the scalability of Pinecone to handle billions of embeddings while maintaining low-latency and high throughput
Utilizing metadata filtering in combination with querying Pinecone's vector database for enhanced search capabilities

In this example, to compare embeddings, we will use the cosine similarity score because this model generates un-normalized probability vectors. While this calculation is trivial when comparing two vectors, it will take quite a long time when needing to compare a query vector against millions or billions of vectors and determine those most similar with the query vector.

What is Pinecone for?
There is often a technical requirement to compare one vector to tens or hundreds of millions or more vectors, to do so with low latency (less than 50ms) and a high throughput. Pinecone solves this problem with its managed vector database service, and we will demonstrate this below.
Pinecone is a fully managed, cloud-native vector database with a simple API and no infrastructure hassles. Once you have vector embeddings in Pinecone, you can manage and search through them to power semantic search, recommenders, and other applications that rely on relevant information retrieval.
